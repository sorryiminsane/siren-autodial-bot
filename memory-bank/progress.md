## Current Tasks

"2025-01-05 20:45:00" - Testing and Validation
- ðŸ”„ Test SIP state tracking with real campaign
- ðŸ”„ Validate fake carrier response detection accuracy

- ðŸ”„ Monitor performance impact of additional AMI event listeners

## Next Steps

"2025-01-05 20:45:00" - System Optimization and Enhancement
- ðŸ“‹ Add timeout-based fake response detection (calls showing ringing > X seconds without answer)
- ðŸ“‹ Implement state-based campaign message updates (show ringing vs failed in real-time)
- ðŸ“‹ Add detailed call progression logging for troubleshooting
- ðŸ“‹ Create campaign analytics dashboard with fake response statistics
- ðŸ“‹ Optimize database queries for high-volume campaign processing
- ðŸ“‹ Add error recovery mechanisms for AMI disconnections during state tracking
