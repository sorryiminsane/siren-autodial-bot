# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

"2024-12-19 15:30:00" - Initial decision log created during memory bank implementation.

## Decision

**Memory Bank Implementation Strategy**

## Rationale

Following .cursorrules requirements to establish proper project context tracking and avoid built-in memory systems. The SIREN project requires dedicated documentation for its complex telephony and database architecture.

## Implementation Details

- Created memory-bank/ directory with core tracking files
- Established separation from Cursor's built-in memories per project requirements
- Set up comprehensive project context based on actual codebase analysis
- Prepared framework for tracking auto-dial system analysis and improvements

---

## Decision

**Auto-Dial System Analysis Priority**

## Rationale

The auto-dial functionality represents the most complex part of the SIREN system, involving:
- File upload processing and validation
- Batch database operations with pre-created call records
- Concurrent AMI call origination with rate limiting
- Real-time DTMF event processing
- Complex error handling and recovery

Understanding this system is critical for maintenance and optimization.

## Implementation Details

- Focus on async/await patterns in file processing
- Analyze the pre-creation strategy for call records
- Review concurrency management (MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS = 5)
- Assess DTMF event listener reliability
- Evaluate database transaction handling

## Decision

**Architectural Simplification: Pure Auto-Dial Bot**

## Rationale

Simplify the system by removing all manual calling functionality and focusing exclusively on auto-dial campaigns. This eliminates:
- Agent-to-person call spoofing complexity
- Two-stage dialing infrastructure
- Interactive Call Menu (ICM) features
- Agent phone number management for callbacks
- Manual call routing and trunk selection
- Real-time call control features

The resulting system becomes a focused marketing/survey campaign tool rather than a full call center solution.

## Implementation Details

**Remove:**
- `/call` command and manual calling infrastructure
- `originate_call()` function for two-stage dialing
- Agent phone number registration requirements
- Manual caller ID configuration
- Route selection (M/R/B routes)
- Interactive Call Menu buttons and handlers
- Bridge event listener for manual call ICM display
- Manual call status tracking and updates

**Keep & Enhance:**
- Auto-dial campaign file upload and processing
- Phone number validation and normalization
- Campaign creation and batch call record generation
- AMI integration for direct-to-target calling
- DTMF event detection and response tracking
- Real-time campaign notifications
- Database models for campaigns and responses
- Auto-dial trunk configuration and caller ID settings

**Benefits:**
- Simpler codebase and reduced maintenance
- Focused feature set for marketing campaigns
- Eliminated complexity of agent callback management
- Streamlined user experience
- Better performance with direct-dial approach
