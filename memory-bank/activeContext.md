"2024-12-19 15:30:00" - Initial creation and memory bank implementation.

## Current Focus

### **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**
**Pure Auto-Dial Bot Transformation**: Stripping all manual calling functionality to create a focused marketing/survey campaign bot.

### System Simplification Goals
- **Remove Agent Callback System**: Eliminate two-stage dialing and agent phone registration
- **Remove Manual Call Controls**: Strip `/call` command, ICM buttons, call routing
- **Streamline User Experience**: Focus purely on campaign upload and DTMF response tracking
- **Simplify Database Models**: Remove agent phone numbers, manual caller IDs, routes

### New System Focus
- **Campaign-Only Operations**: Pure auto-dial campaigns with file upload
- **Direct-to-Target Calling**: Calls go directly to target numbers (no agent callback)
- **DTMF Response Tracking**: Real-time notifications when recipients press digits
- **Simplified Agent Management**: Authorization for campaign access only

## Recent Changes

"2024-12-19 15:30:00" - Memory Bank system implementation initiated per .cursorrules requirements
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Established project context documentation
- Prepared for auto-dial system analysis

"2024-12-19 15:35:00" - **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Transform into pure auto-dial bot
- Decision to remove all manual calling functionality
- Focus exclusively on marketing/survey campaigns
- Simplify codebase by eliminating agent callback complexity

## Open Questions/Issues

### Simplification Implementation Plan
1. **Code Removal Strategy**: What's the cleanest way to strip manual calling code?
2. **Database Migration**: How to handle existing agent phone numbers and manual call data?
3. **UI Streamlining**: Redesign main menu to focus on campaigns only
4. **Feature Preservation**: Ensure all auto-dial functionality remains intact
5. **Configuration Updates**: Modify Asterisk config to remove manual call contexts

### Technical Considerations
- **AMI Event Handlers**: Which event listeners can be removed?
- **Database Schema**: Which tables/columns become obsolete?
- **Asterisk Dialplan**: Simplify extensions.conf to campaign-only contexts
- **Error Handling**: Streamline error scenarios for simpler use cases
- **Performance Impact**: Expected performance improvements from simplification

### Auto-Dial System Analysis Pending
1. **Campaign Processing Flow**: How efficient is the batch processing of phone numbers?
2. **Error Handling**: Are auto-dial failures properly handled and reported?
3. **Concurrency Management**: How does the system handle multiple simultaneous campaigns?
4. **DTMF Response Processing**: Is the event handling robust for auto-dial responses?
5. **Database Performance**: Are the async database operations optimized for scale?

### Technical Debt Assessment Needed
- **Event Listener Efficiency**: Multiple AMI event handlers - potential for optimization?
- **Memory Management**: In-memory tracking vs database consistency
- **Error Recovery**: System resilience during AMI disconnections
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse in file uploads and campaign creation
