"2024-12-19 15:30:00" - Initial creation and memory bank implementation.

## Current Focus

### **P1 PRODUCTION CAMPAIGN SYSTEM DEBUGGING**
**Call State Tracking Issues**: Fixing inaccurate campaign statistics and implementing real-time SIP state monitoring.

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Inaccurate Call Classification**: All calls marked as "completed" instead of distinguishing failed vs successful
- **Active Call Tracking Broken**: Active count never increments, calls not marked as "active" when ringing
- **Fake Carrier Responses**: Carriers send "180 Ringing" responses but block calls, system can't detect this
- **Campaign Statistics Misleading**: Failed calls appear as successful, skewing campaign metrics

### Real-Time SIP State Tracking Implementation
- **AMI Event Integration**: Using Newstate, DialEnd, BridgeEnter events for accurate call progression
- **UniqueID Cross-Reference**: Leveraging existing uniqueid tracking for state correlation
- **Fake Response Detection**: Distinguishing real connections from carrier lies via BridgeEnter events
- **Immediate Failure Detection**: Catching blocked calls without waiting for hangup events

## Recent Changes

"2024-12-19 15:30:00" - Memory Bank system implementation initiated per .cursorrules requirements
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Established project context documentation
- Prepared for auto-dial system analysis

"2024-12-19 15:35:00" - **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Transform into pure auto-dial bot
- Decision to remove all manual calling functionality
- Focus exclusively on marketing/survey campaigns
- Simplify codebase by eliminating agent callback complexity

"2025-01-05 19:45:00" - **P1 CAMPAIGN SYSTEM ANALYSIS**: Identified critical call tracking issues
- Discovered all calls incorrectly marked as "completed" regardless of actual outcome
- Found active call tracking completely non-functional
- Identified fake carrier ringing responses causing inaccurate metrics

"2025-01-05 20:15:00" - **NOTIFICATION SYSTEM CORRECTION**: Previous hardcoded agent ID assumption proven wrong
- User tested with different account while bot remained running
- Notifications correctly delivered to campaign launcher, not hardcoded ID
- System properly tracks campaign ownership and routes notifications accordingly

"2025-01-05 20:30:00" - **CALL CLASSIFICATION LOGIC FIXED**: Implemented proper failed vs completed call detection
- Added duration and status-based classification in hangup event listener
- Calls under 10 seconds or without bridge status now marked as "failed"
- Active call tracking fixed to increment on successful initiation

## Open Questions/Issues

### SIP State Tracking Implementation
1. **AMI Event Selection**: Which specific Newstate values indicate real vs fake progression?
2. **Timeout Configuration**: How long to wait for BridgeEnter before marking as fake response?
3. **Performance Impact**: Will additional event listeners affect system performance?
4. **Error Recovery**: How to handle AMI disconnections during state tracking?

### Campaign Statistics Accuracy
1. **Historical Data**: How to handle existing campaigns with incorrect statistics?
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Ensure campaign message updates reflect accurate state changes
3. **Notification Filtering**: Should fake responses trigger individual notifications?
4. **Reporting Improvements**: What additional metrics would be valuable for users?

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Event Handler Priority**: Order of processing for overlapping AMI events
- **State Persistence**: Should SIP states be stored in database or memory only?
- **Concurrency Handling**: Managing state updates during high-volume campaigns
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting call progression issues

### Simplification Implementation Plan
1. **Code Removal Strategy**: What's the cleanest way to strip manual calling code?
2. **Database Migration**: How to handle existing agent phone numbers and manual call data?
3. **UI Streamlining**: Redesign main menu to focus on campaigns only
4. **Feature Preservation**: Ensure all auto-dial functionality remains intact
5. **Configuration Updates**: Modify Asterisk config to remove manual call contexts

### Technical Considerations
- **AMI Event Handlers**: Which event listeners can be removed?
- **Database Schema**: Which tables/columns become obsolete?
- **Asterisk Dialplan**: Simplify extensions.conf to campaign-only contexts
- **Error Handling**: Streamline error scenarios for simpler use cases
- **Performance Impact**: Expected performance improvements from simplification

### Auto-Dial System Analysis Pending
1. **Campaign Processing Flow**: How efficient is the batch processing of phone numbers?
2. **Error Handling**: Are auto-dial failures properly handled and reported?
3. **Concurrency Management**: How does the system handle multiple simultaneous campaigns?
4. **DTMF Response Processing**: Is the event handling robust for auto-dial responses?
5. **Database Performance**: Are the async database operations optimized for scale?

### Technical Debt Assessment Needed
- **Event Listener Efficiency**: Multiple AMI event handlers - potential for optimization?
- **Memory Management**: In-memory tracking vs database consistency
- **Error Recovery**: System resilience during AMI disconnections
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse in file uploads and campaign creation
